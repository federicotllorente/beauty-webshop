This simple 'webshop' or catalog is made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and initialized with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is the project for the Atida's technical test.

## Getting Started

To start using the project in a development environment, run in the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

And then, enter to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the project.

## SVGR

I used [SVGR Playground](https://react-svgr.com/playground/) for making React components by SVGs.
